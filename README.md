T-Smade: A Two-stage Smart Detector for Evasive Spectre Attacks Under Various Workloads
================================================================================================================
Introduction
------------
This project is designed to detect two evasive Spectre attacks (evasive Spectre nop and evasive Spectre memory) using the two-stage models trained with Spectre attack. <br>
The two-stage models include the first stage workloads classifier and the second stage attack detector. <br>
The workloads include three types: realistic applications (6 appliccations), CPU stress test and memory stress test. <br>
